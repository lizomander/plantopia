## Getting Started

To view the Plantopia website, simply open `index.php` in a web browser. This file serves as the homepage and connects to other parts of the site.

## File Structure

- `index.php` - The homepage where users can navigate to various sections of the site.
- `customer.php` - The customer profile page where users can view and update their account information.
- `shoppingcart.php` - The shopping cart page showing items added to the cart.
- `login.php` - The login page for users to access their accounts.
- `registration.php` - The registration page for new users to sign up.
- `specialityPlantsList.php`, `indoorPlantsList.php`, `outdoorPlantsList.php` - Pages listing different plant categories.

## Usage

The website consists of several linked HTML pages:
- **Home** - The main entry point with links to all other sections.
- **Customer Profile** - Allows users to view and edit profile information.
- **Shopping Cart** - Displays items the user has added to their cart.
- **Login and Registration** - Basic forms for account access and creation.
- **Plant Categories** - Lists of plants grouped by type (indoor, outdoor, speciality).

Each page has links that allow users to move seamlessly between sections.

## Known Issues

Due to restrictions, this project doesnâ€™t include JavaScript or CSS. Therefore, each section is displayed in a linear, scrollable format, without advanced styling or interactive functionality.

## Future Improvements

- Add CSS for improved styling and layout.
- Use JavaScript for enhanced navigation and interactivity.
