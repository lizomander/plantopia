# Web Technologies Portfolio â€“ Plantopia E-Commerce Application

This repository contains the implementation of a web-based plant e-commerce application, developed as part of the **Web Technology** module in the undergraduate AI curriculum.

The project was built using **PHP**, **HTML/CSS/JS**, and **JSON** for data persistence, simulating a simple but functional full-stack application without the use of a traditional database system.

> This application was developed collaboratively as a course assignment. All implementation, design, and logic were created from scratch for educational purposes.

## How to Run Using PHP's Built-in Server

If you don't want to install a full stack like XAMPP or MAMP, you can use PHP's built-in development server. Here's how:

### Prerequisites
- You must have **PHP installed** on your system.
  - To check, run:
    ```
    php -v
    ```

### Steps

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the root folder of this project. For example:
    ```bash
    cd path/to/plantopia-main
    ```
3. Start the PHP development server:
    ```bash
    php -S localhost:8000
    ```

4. Open your browser and go to:
    ```
    http://localhost:8000/index.php
    ```

> This will load the homepage of Plantopia. You can now navigate through the site, use the cart, wishlist, admin pages, etc.

### Notes
- Do not close the terminal while testing â€” the server runs in that window.
- You can stop the server anytime by pressing `CTRL + C`.
